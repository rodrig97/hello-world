# hello-world
Hello! My name is Rodrigo Lozano.
For my project proposal, I would like to make a website where users are able to find places with fewer people either at stores or trails
or any business building or play-grounds. Nowadays with the corona-virus, we worry the most about the elderly people, therefore, users need
places less crowed. As this Website gets more popular it will become more useful because people will be able to sign up. Also, people can
give reviews about places visited.
